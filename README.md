VAST Challenge 2014 - Crime case Analysis


We present a system of multiple interactive and coordinated views to help visualize and analyze several kinds of large-scale data and complex datasets. This design assists to explore social network involved and analyze natural language used in large-scale datasets, then to make an integrated analysis and presentation of all kinds of objects involved in cases in multiple perspectives and hierarchies. We implemented datasets from VAST Challenge 2014 mini challenge 1 to verify the usability of our design.
